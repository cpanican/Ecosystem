# Ecosystem

An application that shows a self sustaining ecosystem. The program will be running on background and the user cannot influence the ecosystemâ€”they can only see what kind of organisms are in the world.

## Structure

`backend` contains the ecosystem's brain. Keeps track of each element and their properties.

`frontend` fetches requests from backend server and displays them on a board like structure.

## Graphics

The sprites will be taken from these resources
